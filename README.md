# TI-84CE-programs

Various Ti programs for various classes

Binomial: Select an option for the type of distribution and input required values. 
          Draws a histogram for the selected distribution and gives the analysis
          
Boxwhisk: Takes the five number summary for a set of data and draws the box and whisker plot complete with an analysis
          
Grapher: Plots points on a static 3d representation. Can connect the points if 2 or 3 dots are plotted

Intg: Integration program. Input function and select the various Reimann sums and other integration approximation formulas

Math: Collection of random small programs

Matrixs: A matrix system of equation solver that can solve up to a 4 variable system while giving all of the steps on how 
         to do it
         
Sim: Not a very versatile program that does repeated probability simulations. Description pending

StemLeaf: Doesn't work very well, but can output a stem and leaf plot for data in the L1 list

Lnrtint: Linear regression t interval calculator. Prompts for confidence interval and x value, and takes data from L1 and L2

Phasm: Not my program but extremely useful (allows the user to run and edit archived programs)

Ratelaw: Program for Chemistry that takes data from L1 and correlates it to a reaction order (either first order, second order or zeroth order)

Varitest: Program for variance hypothesis test with x^2 and p output.
